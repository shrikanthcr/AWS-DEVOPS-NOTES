1)Create one ec2 server , Name it as Prometheus Server.
2)Connect to mobaxterm by using prometheus public ip.
3)install docker 
commands:
yum install docker -y
systemctl start docker
systemctl enable docker
syatemctl status docker

4) create one folder inside the prometheus server , Name it as prometheus.
command: mkdir prometheus
Entry to prometheus folder
command: cd prometheus

5) create vi prometheus.yml file 
command: vi prometheus.yaml

# my global config
global:
  scrape_interval: 15s # Set the scrape interval to every 15 seconds. Default is every 1 minute.

# Here it's Prometheus itself.
scrape_configs:

  - job_name: "prometheus"
    static_configs:
      - targets: ["localhost:9090"]

6) Install prometheus by using docker command.
Command: docker run -d -p 9090:9090 -v /home/ec2-user/prometheus:/etc/prometheus prom/prometheus

docker images = It will show the present available images.
docker ps -a = It will show the all running & available containers.

7) we can access our prometheus page in google by using public ip of prometheus server (3.149.246.203:9090)
- By default prometheus works on 9090 port.

8) Go to prometheus Page 
- Go to status
- Go to Target
- Now we can see the ec2 machine status with up or down.
- It shows green colour when it is up.
- It shows red colour , when it is down.

9) Connect node servers with prometheus server.


- Now we are adding machines to prometheus server.
- login to the Jenkins server -- server name.
- Install Docker 
- commands: 
yum install docker -y
systemctl start docker
systemctl enable docker
syatemctl status docker

- run node exporter command in slave machine (jenkins server) to connect with prometheus server.
- command : docker run -d -p 9100:9100 quay.io/prometheus/node-exporter:v1.2.2
- By default node exporter works on 9100 port (3.14.197.35:9100)
- Now we can access our node exporter page in google by using public ip of slave machine (3.14.197.35:9100).
 
docker ps -a

10)go to the prometheus server 
- open vi prometheus.yml file
command : vi prometheus.yml

# my global config
global:
  scrape_interval: 15s # Set the scrape interval to every 15 seconds. Default is every 1 minute.

# Here it's Prometheus itself.
scrape_configs:

  - job_name: "prometheus"
    static_configs:
      - targets: ["localhost:9090"]
  
  - job_name: "Jenkins-Server"
    static_configs:
      - targets: ["3.14.197.35:9090"]

11) Restart Prometheus container.
command: docker restart container-id

12) Go to Prometheus page by using public ip of prometheus (3.149.246.203:9090)
- Go to status.
- Go to target.
- Refresh the Page.
- Now we can see the slave server status in prometheus GUI.
